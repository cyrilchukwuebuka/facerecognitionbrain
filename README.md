# facerecognitionbrain

This project consumes Clarifai API (the Face Detection Model API) to detect a face in an image
The image is keyed into the sample project through the input field meanwhile, image URL is the required input data.
Once the image is fetched, a call is automatically made to the Clarifai API to provide us with the boundary box values of the detected face which is used to draw a box over the detected face in the image
